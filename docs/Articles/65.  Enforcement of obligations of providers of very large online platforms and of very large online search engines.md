1.   For the purposes of investigating compliance of providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines with the obligations laid down in this Regulation, the Commission may exercise the investigatory powers laid down in this Section even before initiating proceedings pursuant to Article 66(2). It may exercise those powers on its own initiative or following a request pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article.

2.   Where a Digital Services Coordinator has reason to suspect that a provider of a very large online platform or of a very large online search engine has infringed the provisions of Section 5 of Chapter III or has systemically infringed any of the provisions of this Regulation in a manner that seriously affects recipients of the service in its Member State, it may send, through the information sharing system referred to in Article 85, a request to the Commission to assess the matter.

3.   A request pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be duly reasoned and at least indicate:

(a) the point of contact of the provider of the very large online platform or of the very large online search engine concerned as provided for in Article 11;

(b) a description of the relevant facts, the provisions of this Regulation concerned and the reasons why the Digital Services Coordinator that sent the request suspects that the provider of the very large online platforms or of the very large online search engine concerned infringed this Regulation, including a description of the facts that show that the suspected infringement is of a systemic nature;

(c) any other information that the Digital Services Coordinator that sent the request considers relevant, including, where appropriate, information gathered on its own initiative.
