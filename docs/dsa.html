            in favour of the provider of the online platform, the recipient of the service, including the individual or
            entity, shall not be required to reimburse any fees or other expenses that the provider of the online
            platform paid or is to pay in relation to the dispute settlement, unless the out-of-court dispute settlement

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">The fees charged by the out-of-court dispute settlement body to the providers of
            online platforms for the dispute settlement shall be reasonable and shall in any event not exceed the costs
            incurred by the body. For recipients of the service, the dispute settlement shall be available free of
            charge or at a nominal fee.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Certified out-of-court dispute settlement bodies shall make the fees, or the
            mechanisms used to determine the fees, known to the recipient of the service, including to the individuals
            or entities that have submitted a notice, and to the provider of the online platform concerned, before
            engaging in the dispute settlement.</span></p>

            purposes of paragraph 1 or support the activities of some or all out-of-court dispute settlement bodies that

            settlement body no longer meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3. Before revoking that certification,
            the Digital Services Coordinator shall afford that body an opportunity to react to the findings of its

            awarded, upon application by any entity, by the Digital Services Coordinator of the Member State in which
            the applicant is established, to an applicant that has demonstrated that it meets all of the following
            conditions:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) it has particular expertise and competence for the purposes of detecting,
            identifying and notifying illegal content;</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) it carries out its activities for the purposes of submitting notices diligently,
            accurately and objectively.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">3. Trusted flaggers shall publish, at least once a year easily comprehensible and
            detailed reports on notices submitted in accordance with Article 16 during the relevant period. The report
            shall list at least the number of notices categorised by:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) the identity of the provider of hosting services,</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) the type of allegedly illegal content notified,</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) the action taken by the provider.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Those reports shall include an explanation of the procedures in place to ensure that
            the trusted flagger retains its independence.</span></p>

            the names, addresses and email addresses of the entities to which they have awarded the status of the
            trusted flagger in accordance with paragraph 2 or whose trusted flagger status they have suspended in
            accordance with paragraph 6 or revoked in accordance with paragraph 7.</span></p>

            publicly available database, in an easily accessible and machine-readable format, and shall keep the
            database up to date.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">6. Where a provider of online platforms has information indicating that a trusted
            flagger has submitted a significant number of insufficiently precise, inaccurate or inadequately
            substantiated notices through the mechanisms referred to in Article 16, including information gathered in
            connection to the processing of complaints through the internal complaint-handling systems referred to in
            Article 20(4), it shall communicate that information to the Digital Services Coordinator that awarded the
            status of trusted flagger to the entity concerned, providing the necessary explanations and supporting
            documents. Upon receiving the information from the provider of online platforms, and if the Digital Services
            Coordinator considers that there are legitimate reasons to open an investigation, the status of trusted
            flagger shall be suspended during the period of the investigation. That investigation shall be carried out
            without undue delay.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">7. The Digital Services Coordinator that awarded the status of trusted flagger to an
            entity shall revoke that status if it determines, following an investigation either on its own initiative or
            on the basis information received from third parties, including the information provided by a provider of
            online platforms pursuant to paragraph 6, that the entity no longer meets the conditions set out in
            paragraph 2. Before revoking that status, the Digital Services Coordinator shall afford the entity an
            opportunity to react to the findings of its investigation and its intention to revoke the entity&rsquo;s
            status as trusted flagger.</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">4. Providers of online platforms shall set out, in a clear and detailed manner, in
            their terms and conditions their policy in respect of the misuse referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, and
            shall give examples of the facts and circumstances that they take into account when assessing whether
            certain behaviour constitutes misuse and the duration of the suspension.</span></p>

            an average over the period of the past six months and in accordance with the methodology laid down in the
            delegated acts referred to in Article 33(3), where those delegated acts have been adopted.</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">5. Providers of online platforms shall, without undue delay, submit to the Commission
            the decisions and the statements of reasons referred to in Article 17(1) for the inclusion in a publicly

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">6. The Commission may on its own initiative or at the request of the provider, engage
            in a dialogue with the provider to determine whether, in light of the provider&rsquo;s specific
            circumstances, the intended or implemented measures referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), are effective and
            proportionate in achieving the objectives pursued. In particular, the Commission shall ensure that the
            measures taken by the service provider under paragraph 1, point (b), meet the requirements referred to in
            paragraph 3, points (a) and (c).</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">7. The Commission shall monitor the application of the specific measures taken

            in point (c) of that paragraph and any other relevant information, including information it may request
            pursuant to Article 40 or 67, taking into account the evolution of the crisis. The Commission shall report

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Where the Commission considers that the intended or implemented specific measures
            pursuant to paragraph 1, point (b), are not effective or proportionate it may, after consulting the Board,

            measures.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">8. Where appropriate in view of the evolution of the crisis, the Commission, acting
            on the Board&rsquo;s recommendation, may amend the decision referred to in paragraph 1 or in paragraph 7,
            second subparagraph, by:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) revoking the decision and, where appropriate, requiring the very large online

            than three months;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) taking account of experience gained in applying the measures, in particular the
            possible failure of the measures to respect the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter.</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">1. The Board may recommend that the Commission initiate the drawing up, in accordance
            with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, of voluntary crisis protocols for addressing crisis situations. Those situations
            shall be strictly limited to extraordinary circumstances affecting public security or public health.</span>

            platforms or of other online search engines, to participate in the drawing up, testing and application of
            those crisis protocols. The Commission shall aim to ensure that those crisis protocols include one or more
            of the following measures:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) prominently displaying information on the crisis situation provided by Member
            States&rsquo; authorities or at Union level, or, depending on the context of the crisis, by other relevant
            reliable bodies;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) ensuring that the provider of intermediary services designates a specific point
            of contact for crisis management; where relevant, this may be the electronic point of contact referred to in
            Article 11 or, in the case of providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search
            engines, the compliance officer referred to in Article 41;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) where applicable, adapt the resources dedicated to compliance with the
            obligations set out in Articles 16, 20, 22, 23 and 35 to the needs arising from the crisis situation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">3. The Commission shall, as appropriate, involve Member States&rsquo; authorities,
            and may also involve Union bodies, offices and agencies in drawing up, testing and supervising the
            application of the crisis protocols. The Commission may, where necessary and appropriate, also involve civil
            society organisations or other relevant organisations in drawing up the crisis protocols.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">4. The Commission shall aim to ensure that the crisis protocols set out clearly all
            of the following:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) the specific parameters to determine what constitutes the specific extraordinary
            circumstance the crisis protocol seeks to address and the objectives it pursues;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) the role of each participant and the measures they are to put in place in
            preparation and once the crisis protocol has been activated;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) a clear procedure for determining when the crisis protocol is to be
            activated;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(d) a clear procedure for determining the period during which the measures to be
            taken once the crisis protocol has been activated are to be taken, which is strictly limited to what is
            necessary for addressing the specific extraordinary circumstances concerned;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(e) safeguards to address any negative effects on the exercise of the fundamental
            rights enshrined in the Charter, in particular the freedom of expression and information and the right to
            non-discrimination;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(f) a process to publicly report on any measures taken, their duration and their
            outcomes, upon the termination of the crisis situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">5. If the Commission considers that a crisis protocol fails to effectively address
            the crisis situation, or to safeguard the exercise of fundamental rights as referred to in paragraph 4,
            point (e), it shall request the participants to revise the crisis protocol, including by taking additional
            measures.</span></p>

            Coordinator has sufficient autonomy in managing its budget within the budget&#39;s overall limits, in order
            not to adversely affect the independence of the Digital Services Coordinator.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">2. When carrying out their tasks and exercising their powers in accordance with this

    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) the power to require those providers, as well as any other persons acting for
            purposes related to their trade, business, craft or profession that may reasonably be aware of information
            relating to a suspected infringement of this Regulation, including organisations performing the audits
            referred to in Article 37 and Article 75(2), to provide such information without undue delay;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) the power to carry out, or to request a judicial authority in their Member State
            to order, inspections of any premises that those providers or those persons use for purposes related to
            their trade, business, craft or profession, or to request other public authorities to do so, in order to
            examine, seize, take or obtain copies of information relating to a suspected infringement in any form,
            irrespective of the storage medium;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) the power to ask any member of staff or representative of those providers or
            those persons to give explanations in respect of any information relating to a suspected infringement and to
            record the answers with their consent by any technical means.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) the power to order the cessation of infringements and, where appropriate, to
            impose remedies proportionate to the infringement and necessary to bring the infringement effectively to an
            end, or to request a judicial authority in their Member State to do so;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) the power to impose fines, or to request a judicial authority in their Member
            State to do so, in accordance with Article 52 for failure to comply with this Regulation, including with any
            of the investigative orders issued pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(d) the power to impose a periodic penalty payment, or to request a judicial
            authority in their Member State to do so, in accordance with Article 52 to ensure that an infringement is
            terminated in compliance with an order issued pursuant to point (b) of this subparagraph or for failure to
            comply with any of the investigative orders issued pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(e) the power to adopt interim measures or to request the competent national judicial
            authority in their Member State to do so, to avoid the risk of serious harm.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">As regards the first subparagraph, points (c) and (d), Digital Services Coordinators
            shall also have the enforcement powers set out in those points in respect of the other persons referred to
            in paragraph 1 for failure to comply with any of the orders issued to them pursuant to that paragraph. They
            shall only exercise those enforcement powers after providing those other persons in good time with all
            relevant information relating to such orders, including the applicable period, the fines or periodic
            payments that may be imposed for failure to comply and the possibilities for redress.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">3. Where needed for carrying out their tasks under this Regulation, Digital Services
            Coordinators shall, in respect of providers of intermediary services falling within the competence of their
            Member State, where all other powers pursuant to this Article to bring about the cessation of an
            infringement have been exhausted and the infringement has not been remedied or is continuing and is causing
            serious harm which cannot be avoided through the exercise of other powers available under Union or national
            law, also have the power to take the following measures:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) to require the management body of those providers, without undue delay, to
            examine the situation, adopt and submit an action plan setting out the necessary measures to terminate the
            infringement, ensure that the provider takes those measures, and report on the measures taken;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) where the Digital Services Coordinator considers that a provider of intermediary
            services has not sufficiently complied with the requirements referred to in point (a), that the infringement
            has not been remedied or is continuing and is causing serious harm, and that that infringement entails a
            criminal offence involving a threat to the life or safety of persons, to request that the competent judicial
            authority of its Member State order the temporary restriction of access of recipients to the service
            concerned by the infringement or, only where that is not technically feasible, to the online interface of
            the provider of intermediary services on which the infringement takes place.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Digital Services Coordinator shall, except where it acts upon the
            Commission&rsquo;s request referred to in Article 82, prior to submitting the request referred to in the
            first subparagraph, point (b), of this paragraph invite interested parties to submit written observations
            within a period that shall not be less than two weeks, describing the measures that it intends to request
            and identifying the intended addressee or addressees thereof. The provider of intermediary services, the
            intended addressee or addressees and any other third party demonstrating a legitimate interest shall be
            entitled to participate in the proceedings before the competent judicial authority. Any measure ordered
            shall be proportionate to the nature, gravity, recurrence and duration of the infringement, without unduly
            restricting access to lawful information by recipients of the service concerned.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">The restriction of access shall be for a period of four weeks, subject to the
            possibility for the competent judicial authority, in its order, to allow the Digital Services Coordinator to
            extend that period for further periods of the same lengths, subject to a maximum number of extensions set by
            that judicial authority. The Digital Services Coordinator shall only extend the period where, having regard
            to the rights and interests of all parties affected by that restriction and all relevant circumstances,
            including any information that the provider of intermediary services, the addressee or addressees and any
            other third party that demonstrated a legitimate interest may provide to it, it considers that both of the
            following conditions have been met:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) the provider of intermediary services has failed to take the necessary measures
            to terminate the infringement;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) the temporary restriction does not unduly restrict access to lawful information
            by recipients of the service, having regard to the number of recipients affected and whether any adequate
            and readily accessible alternatives exist.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Where the Digital Services Coordinator considers that the conditions set out in the
            third subparagraph, points (a) and (b), have been met but it cannot further extend the period pursuant to
            the third subparagraph, it shall submit a new request to the competent judicial authority, as referred to in
            the first subparagraph, point (b).</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">4. The powers listed in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be without prejudice to Section
            3.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">5. The measures taken by the Digital Services Coordinators in the exercise of their
            powers listed in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be effective, dissuasive and proportionate, having regard, in
            particular, to the nature, gravity, recurrence and duration of the infringement or suspected infringement to
            which those measures relate, as well as the economic, technical and operational capacity of the provider of
            the intermediary services concerned where relevant.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">6. Member States shall lay down specific rules and procedures for the exercise of the
            powers pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 and shall ensure that any exercise of those powers is subject to
            adequate safeguards laid down in the applicable national law in compliance with the Charter and with the
            general principles of Union law. In particular, those measures shall only be taken in accordance with the
            right to respect for private life and the rights of defence, including the rights to be heard and of access
            to the file, and subject to the right to an effective judicial remedy of all affected parties.</span></p>

            infringement and concerning the nature of the involvement of the provider of the very large online platform
            or of the very large online search engine or of the other person concerned. However, the national judicial
            authority shall not call into question the necessity for the inspection nor demand information from the case
            file of the Commission. The lawfulness of the Commission decision shall be subject to review only by the

            or remedy the infringement. Those measures shall include a commitment to perform an independent audit in
            accordance with Article 37(3) and (4) on the implementation of the other measures, and shall specify the
            identity of the auditors, as well as the methodology, timing and follow-up of the audit. The measures may
            also include, where appropriate, a commitment to participate in a relevant code of conduct, as provided for

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">3. Within one month following receipt of the action plan, the Board shall communicate

            Commission shall decide whether the measures set out in the action plan are sufficient to terminate or
            remedy the infringement, and shall set a reasonable period for its implementation. The possible commitment
            to adhere to relevant codes of conduct shall be taken into account in that decision. The Commission shall
            subsequently monitor the implementation of the action plan. To that end, the provider of a very large online
            platform or of a very large online search engine concerned shall communicate the audit report to the
            Commission without undue delay after it becomes available, and shall keep the Commission up to date on steps
            taken to implement the action plan. The Commission may, where necessary for such monitoring, require the
            provider of a very large online platform or of a very large online search engine concerned to provide
            additional information within a reasonable period set by the Commission.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Commission shall keep the Board and the Digital Services Coordinators informed

            engine concerned fails to provide any action plan, the audit report, the necessary updates or any additional
            information required, within the applicable period;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) the Commission rejects the proposed action plan because it considers that the
            measures set out therein are insufficient to terminate or remedy the infringement; or</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) the Commission considers, on the basis of the audit report, any updates or
            additional information provided or any other relevant information available to it, that the implementation
            of the action plan is insufficient to terminate or remedy the infringement.</span></p>
